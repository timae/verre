# Deployment (Deploio / Nine)

- Hosted on Deploio, deployed from `main` on push (Dockerfile build).
- Postgres + Redis + S3-compatible Object Storage all on Nine. Specific app names, project IDs, hostnames, and live URLs are intentionally not in this file — see the Deploio dashboard.

## Env vars set on Deploio (values not stored in repo)

- `REDIS_URL`, `DATABASE_URL` — service connections.
- `AUTH_SECRET` — NextAuth + register-token HMAC. (`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` / `JWT_SECRET` accepted as fallback names by `auth.ts` and `lib/registerToken.ts`.)
- `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`, `S3_REGION` — Object Storage.
- `SERVER_ACTIONS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — comma-separated extra origins for Server Actions CSRF (deployed hostname; `localhost:8080` always allowed; no scheme).
- `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` — used as contact info in the Nominatim User-Agent header when `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is unset; falls back to `'self-hosted'`.
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` (optional) — when set, `/api/places` uses Google Places; when unset, falls back to OSM Overpass + Nominatim.
- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` — opts out of Next.js anonymous build/usage telemetry.
- `GEO_DATA_DIR` (optional) — where the app keeps the downloaded IP→country lookup files; defaults to `/tmp/verre-geo`. Must be a writable dir. Override only if `/tmp` isn't writable on the runner.

## Geo IP→country data (Connected-devices labels)

The "logged in from <country>" labels resolve IPs to countries **in-process** from a self-hosted dataset — the IP never leaves the server (no geo API). Delivery:

1. **Deploy job** (`.deploio.yaml`): after `prisma migrate deploy`, runs `node scripts/refresh-geo-data.mjs`, which fetches public RIR delegated-stats, builds the binary lookup tables, and uploads them to fixed S3 keys (`geo/geo-v4.bin`, `geo/geo-v6.bin`, `geo/geo-cc.json`). **Best-effort**: any failure (source down, timeout, S3 error) is swallowed and the existing S3 copy is kept — it can never fail the deploy.
2. **App at boot** (`instrumentation.ts`): downloads those files from S3 to `GEO_DATA_DIR`. `lib/geo.ts` then queries them on disk.

**Outbound egress requirement**: the deploy job fetches the NRO combined file from `ftp.ripe.net` (fallback: `ftp.arin.net`, `ftp.apnic.net`, `ftp.lacnic.net`, `ftp.afrinic.net`). If the deploy environment has no egress to these hosts, the refresh no-ops and geo stays on the last-good S3 copy (or blank → "Unknown location" on a cold start). Manual refresh from anywhere with egress: `node scripts/generate-geo-table.mjs <dir>` then upload, or just re-run the deploy. Data is stable; monthly-ish is plenty.
